  Regarded as one of the most prominent tourist destinations in India, Keraa, has unique geographical features that gives the state a special place in the world tourism map. The land is bordered by the towering Western Ghats on the west and Arabian Sea on the east. The place is kept green throughout the year by a network of 44 rivers.

  These rivers, except three, originate in the Western Ghats and create a vast network of canals, inlets, streams, rivulets, estuaries and backwaters. The backwaters of Kerala are a labyrinthine system that consists of lagoons and lakes which are linked through many canals. These backwaters witness a number of tourist activities throughout the year.
