<p class="h5-responsive">Orthopaedics is the medical specialty that focuses on injuries and diseases of your body's musculoskeletal system. This complex system, which includes your bones, joints, ligaments, tendons, muscles, and nerves, allows you to move, work, and be active.</p>

<p class="h5-responsive">Once devoted to the care of children with spine and limb deformities, orthopaedists now care for patients of all ages, from newborns with clubfeet to young athletes requiring arthroscopic surgery to older people with arthritis. And anybody can break a bone.

<p class="h5-responsive">Early orthopedists (orthopedic physicians) concentrated on the correction of birth defects such as scoliosis (abnormal sideways curvature of the spine) and clubfoot (deformed foot marked by a curled or twisted shape). Gradually orthopedists included fractures, dislocations, and trauma to the spine and skeleton within their specialty.</p>

<p class="h5-responsive">In the 1930s, a special nail was developed to hold bone fragments together to allow them to heal better. A few years afterward, a metal device was invented to replace the head of a femur (thigh bone) that formed part of the hip joint and that often would not heal after being fractured. Later, a total artificial hip joint was invented. It continues to be revised and improved to allow a patient maximum use and flexibility of the leg.</p>

<p class="h5-responsive"> Current orthopedic specialists continue to apply physical methods to align fractures and restore a disrupted joint. Braces and casts are still used to hold injured bones in place while they heal. Now, however, the physician can take X rays to be certain that the bones are aligned properly for healing to take place. X rays also can be taken during the healing process to make sure that the alignment has not changed and that healing is occurring swiftly.</p>
