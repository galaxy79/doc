<p class="h5-responsive">Cardiology is a branch of medicine related to heart and its diseases. Cardiology means literally the science of heart – in Greek cardia + logia. While today it is one of the most important specializations in medicine, heart remained for many years away from physicians’ interest. For thousands of years, people believed that the liver was far more important organ than it, although some authors, such as Aristotle acknowledged its role as a heat-producing organ.</p>

<p class="h5-responsive">Still, with the general development of medicine, people started to be aware of the heart’s profound role in the body. Especially in the last 100 years, cardiology experienced a revolutionary development, with the dawn of invasive cardiology procedures. Evolution of anesthesia and disinfection helped cardiology specialists conducting more and more complex operations. From heart catheterization to open heart surgery and even heart transplants– cardiologists reached astonishing milestones in order to save lives. </p>
